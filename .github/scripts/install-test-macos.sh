# Opens the Umamo DMG and the Umamo.app zip the way a rigger does - a browser download, so both arrive quarantined -
# and checks what Gatekeeper decides and what the copied app does.
#
# What it proves, in order:
#   * the DMG is signed by the pinned team, notarized, and stapled, and Gatekeeper accepts it as a download;
#   * it opens with no prompt (a license agreement would stop it) and holds Umamo.app and the Applications link;
#   * the app dragged out of it, and the app unpacked from the zip, each verify strictly, carry their own stapled
#     ticket, and are accepted by Gatekeeper as notarized Developer ID code;
#   * the copied app's self-check passes, and it starts.
# The self-check and the launch run on a copy without the quarantine mark: executed from a script, a first launch
# of a quarantined app is the one step a runner cannot answer for a rigger, and Gatekeeper's verdict on it is
# already the assessment above.  A DMG has no install or uninstall of its own: an upgrade is dragging the new app
# over the old one and a removal is deleting it, so there is nothing further to test here.
#
# Usage: install-test-macos.sh <dmg> <zip> <expected team id>

# Written for the bash 3.2 macOS ships.
